# Welcome to Kakeibo:
This project is a simple budgeting tool based on the Japanese budgeting philosophy named Kakeido, aka "the art of saving money". As users manage their individual expenses they become more mindful of their spending habits. Like Kakeido, each expense falls into one of four categories: need, want, cultural, and unexpected. For example, cultural expenses represent anything that broaders an individual's horizons like travel or self improvement. Within this app, users will be able to Create, Read, Update, and Delete expense resources from a React frontent to an Express backend API to a MongoDB database. Users can also see a visual breakdown of their overall spending defined by the four categories of expenses.

###Planning: 
I recently stumbled across Kakeibo just out of curiousity and decided it would make a fun project. Once I had the concept in mind I drew out a quick wireframe for what each view within the app. On each view I drew out the respective functionality. As I drew out the wireframe I wrote down a list of key features and functionality I would need to bring this together. This feature list was a very loose idea; for some features I was unsure what technology or package I would need exactly. I then built the project file structure and key features like authentication first. From there, I built each view from my wireframe and figured out how to implement the features from the list.
