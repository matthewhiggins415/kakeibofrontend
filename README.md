# Welcome to Kakeibo Budgeting:
This project is a simple budgeting tool based on the Japanese budgeting philosophy named Kakeido, aka "the art of saving money". As users manage their individual expenses they become more mindful of their spending habits. Like Kakeido, each expense falls into one of four categories: need, want, cultural, and unexpected. For example, cultural expenses represent anything that broaders an individual's horizons like travel or self improvement. Within this app, users will be able to Create, Read, Update, and Delete expense resources from a React frontent to an Express backend API to a MongoDB database. Users can also see a visual breakdown of their overall spending defined by the four categories of expenses.

### Planning: 
I recently stumbled across Kakeibo just out of curiousity and decided it would make a fun project. Once I had the concept in mind I drew out a quick wireframe for each view within the app to define both look and function. As I drew the wireframe I wrote down a list of key features and functionality needed to bring this project together. This list was a very conceptual; for some features I was unsure what technology or package would work best. I also listed out a quick breakdown of my project file structure. For example, would there be a "Views" folder and "Components" folder in src, this step helps me stay organized as I build. From there, I was ready to setup my project, git/github, and begin.
